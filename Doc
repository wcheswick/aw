aw does its own gatewaying, so (in FreeBSD) /etc/rc.conf

ipv6_gateway_enable="NO"	# this is the default anyway

It relies on the routing tables already configured in the gateway host.
Typically, the gateway will be a host on the internal network, or will
have a route to it.  The default route points to the router handling the
Internet traffic.  Rather than the default route, BGP could be used to
load in the currently announced routes, and the gateway machine can
route to several pipes.
